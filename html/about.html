    <h3>Tools and Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Two side by side maps using Leaflet</li>
      <li>Vue js was used to created the responsive nature of the page</li>
      <li>Gets air quality measurements from the Open AQ Platform for the past 30 days for the area within view of the maps</li>
      <li>UI Filters to choose air particles of interest</li>
      <li>Heatmap visualization overlay on the map when only one particle type selected</li>
      <li>Background color of particle values in the table match the Air Quality Index from the EPA</li>
      <li>Uses the Nominatim API to search via place name in addition to lat/long coordinates</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interesting Finds</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Despite its large size, Portland has almost all good air quality indexes</li>
      <li>We expected Yellowstone to have high amounts of so2 but the level are between 0-1, where we found measurements</li>
      <li>Black Carbon is supported by OpenAQ but is measured in very few cities</li>
      <li>We found many cities such as San Antonio have good conditions during the night but moderate quality during the day</li>
      <li>New Delhi has the only hazardous level of pm2.5 that we have found</li>
      <li>Almost all measurements in Bejing record all of the parameters (excluding black carbon) which is not true for most other places</li>
    </ul>
