# Air Quality Web App
Implementation of CISC 375 Project 2 using Vue.js. Two side-by-side maps allow users to compare different air particles from different locations. 

## Features
* Gets air quality measurements from the Open AQ Platform for the past 30 days for the area within view of the maps
* UI Filters to choose air particles of interest
* Heatmap visualization overlay on the map when only one particle type selected
* Background color of particle values in the table match the Air Quality Index from the EPA
* Uses the Nominatim API (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim (Links to an external site.) to search via place name in addition to lat/long coordinates
